# Kohya's GUI (kohya_ss) Docker Image

Run [Kohya's GUI](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss) in a docker container locally or in the cloud.

>[!NOTE]  
>These images do not bundle models or third-party configurations. You should use a [provisioning script](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image/wiki/4.0-Running-the-Image#provisioning-script) to automatically configure your container. You can find examples in `config/provisioning`.

## Documentation

All AI-Dock containers share a common base which is designed to make running on cloud services such as [vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/vast.ai) as straightforward and user friendly as possible.

Common features and options are documented in the [base wiki](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image/wiki) but any additional features unique to this image will be detailed below.


#### Version Tags
